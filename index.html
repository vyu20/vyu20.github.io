    <h2>About Vanessa</h2>

    <h3>Education</h3>
<p>My name is Vanessa and I am 21 years old. I am a senior at San Francisco State University studying business with a concentration in information systems. Along with the courses I take at SFSU, I've been taking additional programming courses at CCSF. The courses include Programming Fundamentals of Java, Data Structures and Algorithms: Java, and Intro to SQL Databases. This semester I am taking Intro to HTML and CSS as well as Intermediate HTML and CSS. I am taking additional CS and CNIT courses to broaden my career opportunities.</p>
<p>The path to studying information systems was not a smooth one. I initially studied Kinesiology in hopes of becoming a physical therapist. After realizing I had to attend physical therapy school after receiving a bachelors degree, my focus changed to becoming a nurse. After taking a course in Chemistry and Anatomy, I soon realized that the medical field was not for me. I decided to push myself out of my comfort zone by styudying something I never could have imagined myself studying. That is how I decided to study information systems.</p>

    <h3>Random Information</h3>
<p>My morning routine consists of waking up at 7am and cuddling with my dog for a few minutes. After I get out of bed, I drink water, brush my teeth, apply spf moisturizer, and walk my dog with my parents. We walk in a park that is a few blocks away from our house for about an hour. After the walk, I make a bowl of oatmeal topped with lots of fruits and a heafy spoonful of almond butter. I've been eating the same breakfast for months because of the large selection of summers fruits available. After breakfast, I work on homework the rest of the morning. </p>
<p>I have an eight year old Pomeranian dog named Rita. Over the years my friends and family have given her many nicknames such as:<br>
Dorita<br>
Piggy<br>
Baby Rita<br>
Taztingle<br>
Ritsmagits<br>
Most of these names are completely random and I do not remember how they were created. Rita is very talented. Some of her tricks include sitting, rolling over, closing the refrigerator, playing dead, giving her paw, turning around, and laying down. Rita's fur grows extremely fast, so she needs to be groomed every 2 months. Getting her groomed is expensive, so this year I decided to learn how to cut her fur myself. I can proudly say that I am slowly getting better at cutting her fur. Although Rita is eight years old, people often mistake her for a puppy. When I walk Rita, I've shocked many strangers with her age.</p>

<p>This concludes my first webpage! I've never worked with HTML before, so this was a great learning experience. I'm amazed with how much I've already learned this week. I'm looking forward to learning about more components of HTML and learning how to style the webpage with CSS. The most rewarding part about this assignment is opening the .html file in a web browser and seeing everything organized neatly.</p>
